# every-day-app

Habit tracker mobile app which takes numeric input, not solely a checkmark for the day.  
Though likely could accomodate Android as react-native is designed to be multi-platform, the current build is only tested on ios. 

Built Using [React Native](https://reactnative.dev) 

Startup (ios):  `npx run-ios`
